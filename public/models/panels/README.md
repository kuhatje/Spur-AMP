# Daylun Panel 3D Models

Place your GLB model files in this directory:

## Required Files:
- `daylun-4x8-panel.glb` - 4×8 Standard Panel 3D model
- `daylun-8x8-panel.glb` - 8×8 Professional Panel 3D model

## Model Requirements:
- **Format**: GLB (binary GLTF)
- **Scale**: Real-world scale (4'×8' and 8'×8' respectively)
- **Orientation**: Front face facing positive Z direction
- **Materials**: Include textures and materials for realistic appearance
- **Optimization**: Optimized for web viewing (< 5MB per model recommended)

## Integration:
Once you place the GLB files here, they will automatically appear in the Component Library's 3D viewer with full interactivity (rotate, zoom, pan).

The system will gracefully fall back to 2D technical drawings if the 3D models are not available.
